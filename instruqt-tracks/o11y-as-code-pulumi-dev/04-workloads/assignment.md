üß™ Step 1: Explore o11y/index.ts
=======================

Using the Editor tab, navigate to `o11y/index.ts`

```
vim o11y/index.ts
```

- Explore what's possible by leveraging `o11y/resources/Workloads.ts`

üß™ Step 2: Use Workloads to organize your resources
=======================

Add this after `// TODO: Add workloads here`
```
import Workload from "./resources/Workloads"
```

- Tag the workload using your team, i.e.

```
const myWorkload = Workload(
  'O11yAsCode Workload Example (Pulumi)',
  `tags.team = 'acme_corp'`
)
```

- Expose the URL to your workload
```
export const workload_permalink = myWorkload.permalink
```

üèÅ Step 3: pulumi up
=========

- After running `pulumi up` you should see a workload_permalink output value linking to your New Relic Workload!

```
pulumi up
```
