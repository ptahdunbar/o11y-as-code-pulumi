üß™ Step 1: Explore o11y/index.ts
=======================

- Using the Editor tab, navigate to `o11y/index.ts`

```
vim o11y/index.ts
```

=======================

Add this after `// TODO: Add dashboards here`
```
import DashboardJson from "./resources/Dashboards"
```

- Using the `DashboardJson` API, you can pass in a relative path to the dashboard json.
- The second argument allows you to optionally override parts of the dashboard.

```
const myTeamDashboard = DashboardJson(
  './dashboards/node.json',
  {
    name: 'O11y as Code Dashboard (Pulumi)'
  }
)
```

- Expose the URL to the dashboard
```
export const dashboard_permalink = myTeamDashboard.permalink
```

üèÅ Step 3: pulumi up
=========
