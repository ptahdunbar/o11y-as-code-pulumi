üß™ Step 1: Install dependencies
=======================

Navigate to the o11y directory and install the pulumi dependencies

```
cd o11y
npm install
```
üß™ Step 2: Add your pulumi access token
=======================

- Prepare pulumi to use your access token. You may need to create one if you don't already have one.
```
pulumi login
```

- run `pulumi stack init` -- and name it `dev`.

```
pulumi stack select
```

üèÅ Step 3: Configure your Pulumi stack
=========

- Configure pulumi to use your [New Relic Account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id/).

```
pulumi config set newrelic:accountId 01234567
```

- Configure pulumi to use your [New Relic User API Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#api-table).
- Note that it should start with "NRAK-".

```
pulumi config set newrelic:apiKey --secret NRAK-YYYYYYYYYYYYYY
```

- To receive alert notification emails, configure your `notifyViaEmail` to use your email address.

```
pulumi config set o11y-as-code-pulumi-newrelic-workshop:notifyViaEmail user@acme.email
```

- Finally, confirm everything is working by running `pulumi up`
```
pulumi up
```
